# CSE 110 Group Project - **Physics Dungeon**

## Overview

Physics Dungeon is a **level-based** educational game designed for learning **physics** through interactive simulations.
Each level focuses on a core mechanics concept and challenges the player to both learn and apply those concepts to progress.  
The **goal** is to complete all learning stages to unlock two final mini-games.  
Instead of defeating enemies, players defeat physics problems by applying what they’ve learned throughout the game.

## Rules

1. Complete all levels to unlock the final mini-games.
2. Each level has two phases: **Theory** Phase and **Simulation** Phase.
3. In mini-games, you have three lives:
   - Each incorrect answer costs one life.
   - Losing all lives requires restarting the mini-game.
4. The Formula Menu updates automatically after completing a level and it is accessible from the map.
5. You can replay previously completed levels at any time to review the topics.
6. Correct answers and completed levels are saved under your username.
7. Completing all stages and both final mini-games finishes the game.
